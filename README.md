# Business Analyzer Website

Welcome to the Business Analyzer website repository! This project utilizes a modern stack to deliver a powerful and efficient web application for business analysis.

## Technologies Used

### 1. React + Vite

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a fast build tool for modern web applications. Together, they provide a lightning-fast development experience with features like hot module replacement and optimized production builds.

### 2. Tailwind CSS

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a utility-first CSS framework that helps you build modern and responsive user interfaces. With its utility classes, you can quickly style your components without leaving your HTML file.

### 3. TypeScript

[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is a typed superset of JavaScript that enhances the development experience by providing static typing. This helps catch errors early in the development process and improves code maintainability.

### 4. React-Typed

[React-Typed](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-typed) is a React component for creating dynamic and customizable typing animations. It's used in the project to add engaging and interactive typed text effects.
